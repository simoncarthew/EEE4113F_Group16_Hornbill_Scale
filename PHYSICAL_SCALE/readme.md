# PHYSICAL SCALE
## Overview
The problem analysis identified the need for a non-invasive method to weigh individual adult Southern
Ground-Hornbill birds, providing an insight into how warmer temperatures can affect the their
physiologies. This could be achieved by leveraging an individual birdâ€™s weight onto a load cell, as well
as making use of a temperature sensor to monitor the external temperature and a camera trap to
capture footage of the birds. This subsystem includes the housing of these components, as well as the integration 
of the load cell. The design was created with the researchers at the APNR Southern Ground-Hornbill Research and
Conversation Project and the FitzPatrick Institute of African Ornithology, as the intended users.
