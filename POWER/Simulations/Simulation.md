# Simulations
All the Subsystem were simulated but only the results of the PWM controller(NE555) and Buck Converter are shown here.
### Simulation and Testing Environment
* The PWM controller was simulated using LT-Spice and the file was attached.
* The Buck Converter was simulated using MATLAB and the file was attached.
