# Functional and Schematic Diagrams
This section demonastrates how the subsubsystem interact with one another. Addtionally, it demonstrates the power flow and the stages involved from the harvesting Stage down to the regulation stage
### Block diagram
Attached is a .png file serving as the Atomic Level Solution of the system.
### Schmatic diagram
The Schematic file attached is KiCAD file demonstrating the low level system description and the integrated components
